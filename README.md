# terralang-termux 
just run build.sh.

if termux crashes or the process get killed by android during compilation edit the build.sh last line from `make install -j4` to `make install -j3` or less. you can also increase it to faster compiling, but bigger it is bigger will also be the chances of getting the process killd.
