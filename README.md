get pre-compiled binaries in releases(aarch64 only)

# build 

if you want to build it yourself just run build.sh.

if for some reason termux crashes during compilation, run build.sh again and again until it compiles(may crash several times depending on the device performance idk why).

if u facing too much crashes during compiling try keeping the screen on during compiling process.
